# CSC1018 - Module Repository

Welcome to the **CSC1018** repository! This repository contains coursework and assignments for the CSC1031 module.

**Note**: This directory structure representation was generated with the assistance of AI because the author was feeling a bit lazy.

## Repository Structure

The files in this repository are organized by weeks to reflect the progression of the course. Each week’s assignment and related files are stored in their respective folders. The files are `.pl` files.
There is an additional directory for the end of year assignment.

## Execution

To execute any given file, I recommend using the SWIPL-PROLOG interface in the command line.
The file must first be imported to the current session.

```
['Task1.pl']
```

To check if the file is loaded

```
current_file('avlTree.pl').
```

### Running the Program

After compiling, you can run the commands using:

```
command(parameter1, parameter2)
```

Make sure to replace `command` with the appropriate command for your specific file.
